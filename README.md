# Hardcore Punk Jam
Somewhat deprecated build of work done for Hardcore Punk Jam 3 -- play the full build at https://desertfunction.itch.io/typermania
Art & code done by me, sounds done by GiantPeachAudio (https://itch.io/profile/giantpeachaudio , https://youtube.com/channel/UCM08NMYPE46pMsfhkkOjFcw , https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/27ua4) 

Issues:
      When this project was originally finished, I tried to push the entire folder including the Library and Builds folders I had. 
      Big mistake -- github 100mb limit prevented the push. I ended up several local commits ahead and unable to push anything. 
      Having made a backup before I added menu + game music and enemy sounds, I reset the local commits to this repos commits
      and did my best to restore the changes. That means that this build, while functionally complete, is missing the music 
      and sounds that make it really alive. 
      
TL;DR: This build doesnt have music/sounds like the real version does. Go play that instead.
